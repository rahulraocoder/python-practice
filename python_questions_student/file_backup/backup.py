File Backup Utility Problem

Objective:
Create a utility that can:
1. Backup files with timestamp suffix
2. Restore files from backup
3. List available backups
4. Handle errors (missing files, permissions)

Example:
backup_file("report.txt") -> "report_20240405_1612.txt"
restore_file("report_20240405_1612.txt") -> "report.txt"
